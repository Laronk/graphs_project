# Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm

## Purpose (solved problem)

An algorithm for **finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph**.


### Use cases

* calculating least-cost paths to establish tracks of electricity lines or oil pipelines.
* calculating optimal long-distance footpaths in Ethiopia and contrast them with the situation on the ground.

### Current methods of solving the problem (addressed by the algorithm)
